# New World Modular NWM-01 MIDI→CV Converter (firmware)

The NWM-01 is an open hardware MIDI-to-CV converter for the Eurorack format, based on the Arduino platform. It's designed to be inexpensive and easy to clone, with a low component count and all components cheap to buy in multiples from your favourite supplier. It began as an experiment around just how far a simple set of inexpensive components could be pushed.

This repository is for the firmware only; for the hardware files see [https://github.com/jimbovm/nwm-01]().

**⚠ Both firmware and hardware for the NWM-01 are works progress and still in development.**
